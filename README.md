Hello mate, I am Tiago Bellas ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

## About me

I am a Senior Data Analyst & Data Scientist passionate about uncovering valuable insights from complex datasets. My professional journey has been marked by years of solid experience working on a diverse range of projects, including marketing, operations, sales, quality assurance, data & reporting, portfolio management, and many other areas. These projects have involved direct and indirect contributions to various aspects of data-driven decision-making.

## Projects

### [Data Science Project | Stock_Sentiment_Classification](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Data_Science_Project_Stock_Sentiment_Classification)
The goal of this project is to develop an NLP model capable of predicting market sentiment based on tweets. In summary, using NLP techniques, the model must be able to classify tweets received as input and predict, for each tweet, whether it describes a Bearish (0), Bullish (1), or Neutral (2) attitude.


### [Data Science Project | Melanoma Tumor Detection](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Data_Science_Project_Melanoma_Tumor_Detection)
This is an Academic project of Data Science Pos Degree which involves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras framework that can accurately detect and classify Melanoma Tumors


### [Data Science Project | Automobile Insurance Portfolio](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Insurance-Price-Predict)
This project contains data and analyses related to the automotive insurance portfolio and its claims. The goal is to build models that can predict insurance prices and analyze claim trends.



### [Data Science Project | Asset and Portfolio Management](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Computational_Finance_for_Asset_and_Portfolio_Management)
This is an Academic project of Data Science Pos Degree which involves investigating the empirical properties of financial market returns using US stock market data and testing the performance of various portfolio investment strategies.



### [Data Science Project | Bonds Issues](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Computational_Finance_for_Bonds_Issues)
This is an academic project presented in the Data Science Postgraduate Program, which consists of financial data analysis, including constructing yield curves, analyzing historical stock data, and manipulating DataFrames.



### [Data Science Project | Houses Price Prediction](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Data_Science_Project_Houses_Price_Prediction)
An unnamed company provides estimates of house prices to customers. However, the model is maybe not as accurate as it could be and it makes errors in itâ€™s estimates. Project data i have access to an extract of their dataset and a data dictionary to help you understand the column titles. However, i could explore this data for myself, maybe not all of it is useful, some of it is leaking information. I also needed to clean the data including dealing with null values, different data types, categorical variables, feature engineering and outliers.



### [Data Science Project | Loans Default Prediction](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Data_Science_Project_Loans_Default_Prediction)
Lending Club is an American peer-to-peer lending company, which provides an online platform that connects borrowers and investors. By cutting out the traditional banking protocol, it aims to provide loans at a lower interest rate. However, the risk of borrowers defaulting (i.e., being charged off) on loans is an ever-present concern, as is the need to better understand their customer base for optimized loan offering and risk mitigation.



### [Data Science Project | Fixed Income Securities](https://github.com/TiagoBellas/Data_Science_Project_for_Fixed_Income)
This is an academic project presented in the Data Science Postgraduate Program, which consists:
- Computation the accrued interest
- Simulation of 10000 scenarios for the inflation rate curve and CPI index
- For each scenario above, calculation the ILB cash flows and estimate their fair value
- Estimative and analyse the inflation linked bond price distribution, including interest rate and inflation risk measures.
